# @debounce
---

The debounce decorator delays the execution of a method until after a specified wait time has elapsed since the last time it was invoked. This is useful for limiting the rate at which a method is executed, such as in response to user input events.

<CodeBlock >
```typescript
@debounce(1000) doSomething() {...}
```
</CodeBlock>
