# Lite Context
---

Lite Context is a way to share data between components without having to pass props down through the component tree.

It is based on the [community protocols proposal](https://github.com/webcomponents-cg/community-protocols/blob/main/proposals/context.md).

## Creating a Context

To create a context you can use the `createContext` function. This function takes a generic type that represents the type of the context.

<CodeBlock lang='typescript'>{`export const myContext = createContext<{ value: string }>(Symbol('my-context'));`}</CodeBlock>

Please read the [context provider documentation](/docs/context/context-provider) to learn how to provide a context to a component and the [context consumer documentation](/docs/context/context-consumer) to learn how to consume it.
