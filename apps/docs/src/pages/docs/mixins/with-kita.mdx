# WithKita
---

This is a mixin that provides to the element the ability to use jsx syntax.

[Kitajs](https://github.com/kitajs/html/tree/master/packages/html#readme) is a very lightweight library that allows you to use jsx syntax.

It's very light and easy to use, and it's a great alternative to other rendering libraries.

Gzip size is around 2kb.

<CodeBlock lang='typescript'>{`@customElement('my-jsx-element')
export class MyJsxElement extends WithKita(RadiantElement) `}</CodeBlock>
