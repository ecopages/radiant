# Introduction

**Radiant** is a minimalist web component library designed for simplicity, flexibility, and performance. It provides a lightweight set of decorators and a base class to streamline the development of modern web components.

## Key Features

- **Light DOM by Default**: Leverages the light DOM for seamless integration with global CSS and easier manipulation.
- **Declarative Reactivity**: Simple decorators for managing properties, internal state, and attribute synchronization.
- **Event Management**: Built-in event emitters and declarative event subscription.
- **Minimal Overhead**: Focuses on the core features needed for robust components without the bloat of larger frameworks.

## Why Radiant?

While many web component libraries focus on isolating components via the Shadow DOM, Radiant embraces the **Light DOM**. This approach is ideal for projects that require:

1. **Global Styling**: Use your existing CSS framework or utility-first CSS (like Tailwind) without additional configuration.
2. **Simplified Interaction**: Easier integration with other libraries and standard browser APIs.
3. **Performance**: Reduced overhead from shadow root creation and management.
