## 0.1.8

### Patch Changes

- [`dd0689c`](https://github.com/ecopages/radiant/commit/dd0689c36181be128d393c37e014396373ffda16) - Added @bound decorator to simplify the binding of methods that runs in untracked events

## 0.1.7

### Patch Changes

- [`1504dff`](https://github.com/ecopages/radiant/commit/1504dffb70da7dfd955faf61ea45f03b2427803b) - - Changed the way hydration on context occurs to follow the best practices for web components. Now the hydration data is not passed anymore as an attribute but using a script tag of type json with a `data-hydration` attribute.
  - Refactored `stringifyAttribute` to `stringifyTyped` for better clarity and flexibility. Updated the function to handle both JSON stringification and type preservation based on generic parameters. Now it is possible to return both the type (for jsx usage on atribute) or a string (i.e. for context hydration)
