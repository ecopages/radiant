# Radiant

Radiant is a minimalist web component library designed for simplicity and flexibility.

It leverages the light DOM, allowing components to be styled and manipulated with standard CSS and JavaScript, unlike traditional web components that use the shadow DOM.

This approach deviates from conventional [web component best practices](https://web.dev/articles/custom-elements-best-practices), offering a trade-off for a more streamlined development experience.

Ideal for any kind of projects, Radiant provides a lightweight alternative to full web components implementations, reducing unnecessary overhead.
